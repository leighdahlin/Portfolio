# Portfolio

## Summary

Welcome to my portfolio! This page features my projects, contact information and some information about me and my
journey to becoming a web developer. The key features of my page include:

 * Links at the top of the page that transport you to the different sections of my page
 * One of the links, Resume, will open a copy of my resume pdf in a new window
 * An about me section that includes a picture of me and a paragraph about myself
 * A work section that features projects that I have created or collaborated on with a group, when you click on the picture, a modal pops up to give you more information
 * A contact me section that provides my phone number and links to my Github and LinkenIn accounts

## Technologies

* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Bootstrap


## Key Features

I added the following elements to my page to make it more dynamic:

* When open the portfolio page, you click on 'View Portfolio' and are transported to my about me section
* When clicking on the 'View Portfolio' button or links at the top of the page, the elements on the page transition using opacity
* When the links at the top are hovered over, they are underlined
* The picture in the about me section is rounded through CSS
* The first project's stock image in my Work section is larger than the rest below it
* In my work section, when you hover over the stock image for each project, they grow larger, lose their opacity and have a box shadow
* I used modal to display more information about each project, including links to the repository and  deployed page, a description of the project and screenshots
* Media queries allow my page to be responsive on smaller screens
